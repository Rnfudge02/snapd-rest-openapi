## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the project.

### **Reporting Bugs**

If you find a bug in the API specification (e.g., an incorrect data type, a missing field, or a confusing description),
please **[open a new issue](https://github.com/canonical/snapd-rest-openapi/issues)** in our issue tracker.

Please include:
* A clear and descriptive title.
* A detailed description of the bug, including the specific endpoint and field.
* What you expected to happen.
* What actually happened.

### **Suggesting Enhancements**

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one,
please **[open a new issue](https://github.com/rnfudge02/canonical/issues)** to discuss it.
This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### **Your First Code Contribution**

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
These are typically smaller changes that are a great way to get familiar with the project's workflow.
