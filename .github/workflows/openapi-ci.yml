name: 'OpenAPI CI: Validate & Generate Docs'

# This workflow runs on every pull request that targets the 'main' branch.
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ] # Adjust if your main branch has a different name (e.g., 'master')

jobs:
  # A single job that runs all steps in sequence.
  # If any step fails, the entire job fails.
  validate-and-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Make the controller script executable
      - name: Make script executable
        run: chmod +x openapi-controller.sh

      # Step 3: Install all dependencies (Python, Node, Redocly, etc.)
      # This runs the --install command from your script to set up the environment.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --install

      # Step 4: Validate the OpenAPI specification.
      # If this fails, the 'set -e' in your script will stop the workflow here.
      - name: Validate OpenAPI Specification
        run: source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" && ./openapi-controller.sh --validate

      # Step 5: Generate the standalone Swagger UI documentation.
      - name: Generate Standalone Swagger UI Docs
        run: source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" && ./openapi-controller.sh --swagger

      # Step 6: Generate the Sphinx-integrated documentation.
      - name: Generate Sphinx Integration Docs
        run: source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" && ./openapi-controller.sh --sphinx

      # Step 7 (Optional but Recommended): Upload the generated docs as artifacts.
      # This allows you to download and review the generated HTML files from the PR check.
      - name: Upload Swagger UI Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: swagger-ui-docs
          path: index.html # Path to the standalone swagger file

      - name: Upload Sphinx Docs Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: sphinx-docs
          path: docs/_static/api/ # Path to the sphinx docs folder
