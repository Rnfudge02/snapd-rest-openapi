name: 'OpenAPI CI: Validate & Generate Docs'

# This workflow runs on every pull request that targets the 'main' branch.
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ] # Adjust if your main branch has a different name (e.g., 'master')

jobs:
  # A single job that runs all steps in sequence.
  # If any step fails, the entire job fails.
  validate-and-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Make the controller script executable
      - name: Make script executable
        run: chmod +x openapi-controller.sh

      # Step 3: Install all dependencies (Python, Node, Redocly, etc.)
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --install

      # Step 4: Export the Node.js binary path for subsequent steps
      # This is the key fix that makes tools like 'redocly' available everywhere.
      - name: Export Node.js paths
        run: |
          source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
          NODE_PREFIX=$(npm prefix -g)
          echo "${NODE_PREFIX}/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

      # Step 5: Validate the OpenAPI specification.
      # The 'source' command is no longer needed here.
      - name: Validate OpenAPI Specification
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --validate

      # Step 6: Generate the standalone Swagger UI documentation.
      - name: Generate Standalone Swagger UI Docs
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --swagger

      # Step 7: Generate the Sphinx-integrated documentation.
      - name: Generate Sphinx Integration Docs
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --sphinx

      # Step 8: Upload the generated docs as artifacts.
      # I've also corrected the path for the swagger-ui-docs artifact.
      - name: Upload Swagger UI Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
