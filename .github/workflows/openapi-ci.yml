name: 'OpenAPI CI: Validate & Generate Docs'

# This workflow runs on every pull request that targets the 'main' branch.
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ] # Adjust if your main branch has a different name (e.g., 'master')

jobs:
  validate-and-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      # This is the key fix. This action reliably installs Node.js and adds it,
      # along with the global npm bin directory, to the PATH for all subsequent steps.
      # It also enables caching for faster installs on future runs.
      - name: Set up Node.js v22
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Make the controller script executable
      - name: Make script executable
        run: chmod +x openapi-controller.sh

      # Step 4: Install all dependencies
      # The script will now use the Node.js environment set up by the previous step.
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --install

      # The manual "Export Node.js paths" step is no longer needed.

      # Step 5: Validate the OpenAPI specification.
      - name: Validate OpenAPI Specification
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --validate

      # Step 6: Generate the standalone Swagger UI documentation.
      - name: Generate Standalone Swagger UI Docs
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --swagger

      # Step 7: Generate the Sphinx-integrated documentation.
      - name: Generate Sphinx Integration Docs
        run: ./openapi-controller.sh --sphinx

      # Step 8: Upload the generated docs as artifacts.
      - name: Upload Swagger UI Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: swagger-ui-docs
          path: docs/swagger/

      - name: Upload Sphinx Docs Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
