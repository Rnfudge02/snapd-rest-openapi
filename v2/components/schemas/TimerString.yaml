type: string
description: |
  A custom schedule format for defining recurring events, combining weekdays, times, spans, and frequencies.

  **Syntax Summary:**
  - A timer string is composed of one or more event sets, separated by `,,`.
  - Each event set can define weekdays (`mon`, `tue`, `wed2`, `fri5`) and time windows (`10:00`, `09:00-11:00`).
  - Weekday spans (`mon-fri`) define an event for each day in the span.
  - Time spans (`14:00-16:00`) define a single event within the span, which can be divided using a count (`/2`).

  For the complete specification, see the [timer string documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/timer-string-format).
pattern: '^[a-zA-Z0-9,:~\/-]+$'
example: "mon-wed,fri,9:00-11:00/2"
