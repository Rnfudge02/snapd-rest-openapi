  parameters:
    - name: types

      description: |-
        If types is specified, only return notices with types matching the given
        types. The types parameter can include multiple types, notices matching
        any of the types are returned.
      schema:
        $ref: '../components/schemas/NoticeType.yaml'
    - name: keys

      description: If specified, only return notices with one of the given keys.

      description: |-
        If specified, only return notices with a 'last-repeated' field greater
        than the specified time, which should be in RFC3339 UTC format.
      schema:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: 2025-09-08T17:29:40.829324752Z
    - name: timeout
      in: query
      description: |-
        If there are notices matching the filter which have already been
        recorded, these notices are returned immediately. Otherwise, if timeout
        is specified, wait up to the given duration for any new notices matching
        the filter to be recorded. This allows the user to use long-polling to
        be notified immediately when a new notice is recorded.
      schema:

        Admin only.
        Instead of returning notices associated with the user who initiated the
        API request, return notices associated with the given UID. Public
        notices are still returned, as before. Cannot be used with the 'users'
        parameter.
      schema:
        type: integer
        example: 1000
    - name: users
      in: query
      description: |-
        Admin only.
        Value must be 'all'. Return notices associated with all users, instead
        of just the user which initiated the API request. Cannot be used with
        the 'user-id' parameter.
